                    Let's just start with the obvious choice shall we? Have you ever seen anything as cute as a 
                    French bulldog puppy? <em>No you have not.</em> I'm a softie when it comes to squish-faced dog 
                    breeds (maybe because it's easier for them to give kisses when they don't have a big snout obstructing 
                    them), so it's really no surprise that these little boys top the list. Plus, they're French, so they're 
                    automatically classy.

                    Is that a... a cloud? A marshmallow? Wait... now three little black dots have come into focus. Oh my god, 
                    that's a dog. And what a dog it is! Majestic, noble, yet fluffy as all get out and the purest white fur you 
                    can find outside of the arctic circle make this dog one of the most wonderful dog breeds to exist. The white 
                    fur also adds an additional bonus: it's really easy to splash some color on there and make a Samoyed look 
                    like a mystical creature from another dimension.

                    Basset hounds are great because they always have a positive attitude. You sort of have to be relentlessly 
                    positive if you're born with ears meant for an elephant attached to a head no bigger than a softball. But 
                    they make it work so well! Sure, a windy day might blow their ears all over the place like two small wind socks, 
                    but that only adds to the basset hound's charm. This is a 10/10 dog.

                    Am I the only one who thinks these dogs look like they're some warrior-dog companion that can control the 
                    earthly elements with its mind? Yes? Okay, fine. But you've got to admit that these dogs look awesome. The 
                    gray and black striations leading into white and brown patches gives the Australian shepherd a sort of 
                    superhero-esque look. Attach a cape to one of these dogs and you have your brand new cuddly comic book 
                    character.

                    Shiba Inus look more refined and aloof than even the haughtiest of aristocrats. There's no such thing
                    as a Shiba that isn't photogenic; go ahead, try and find a bad picture of this dog, <strong>I dare you.</strong> 
                    Give up? Yeah, that's because it can't be done. But Shibas are more than just refined and good picture 
                    models. They're also silly and fun and they have squeezable cheeks. All in all, definitely a great dog.

                    Originally bred on the plains of the African savannah to hunt game, these dogs are alert, attentive, and 
                    are especially suited for lots of outside activity. Instead of barking, Basenjis let out a high-pitched howl 
                    that sounds really strange (but is also very cool). Additionally, Basenjis are not a particularly common 
                    breed, so having one of these little guys by your side is sure to turn heads on the street.

                    Ah, the humble pug. Compact, curious, and something of a clown. Pugs are the squish-faced 
                    little comedians of the canine world - they're like ultra-dense neutron stars if neutron stars 
                    were made of joy and laughter instead of hot gaseous elements. On a scale from 1 to Good Dog, pugs 
                    top the scale, snorting and clumsily bounding along the way.
